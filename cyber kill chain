<The term kill chain is a military concept which identifies the structure of an attack>


#Reconnaissance:  information gathering about the target

	Goal: Find weakness 


Passive reconnaissance - is an attempt to gain information about targeted computers and networks without actively engaging with the system. 
	Google Dork, Shodan IO, WhoIS, VirusTotal
	
	Protect: limit public information.. modify the server error messgaes.
	
	
Active reconnaissance - attacker/intruders engages with the target system, typically conducting a port scan and vulerablities.
	Nmap, Nussus, OpenVAS, Nikto, Metasploit
	
	Protect: Disable unused ports and services.. Honeyport.. Firewall IPS.. TOR and 3rd Party VPN inbound blocking.. 
	

	
# Weaponization: find or create the attack to exploit the weakness using payload.
	
	Cain and Abel.. SQLMap.. AirCrack.. Metasploit.. Exploit-DB.. Veil Framework.. Wapiti.. Brupsuite.. TheFatRat
	

	Defensive
		
		administrative control	: patch management.. disable::office-macros.. javaScript and brower-plugins
		technical control		: AV .. IPS.. Email Security.. MFA.. Audit Logging.. 	
		
		
# Delivery : transmission of weapon  to target via email attachment.. websites and usb drivers..
		
		websites 		- web/dns filtering
		social media 	- phishing campaigns
		user input 		- ips/ids
		email			- dkim & spf
		usb				- disable usb no admin rights
	

# Explitation : attack executed..

		sql injection.. buffer-overflow.. javascript hijack.. malware			
		
		protect: dep (data execution prevention).. anti-exploit
		detect : sanboxing
		
    
# Installation : payload injected after the exploit to gain access..

		dll hijacking.. meterpreter.. remote access tools (rat).. registry changes.. powershell commands.. 
		
		protect	 : linux:chroot | windows: disabled powershell
		detect 	 : uba/edr
		response : follow incident response sops
		recover  : restore or reimage
		
# Commanad & Control:  remote control of the system..  (C&C means system has been compromised)
		
		network segmentation  (isolate)
		micro segmentation 	  (isolate)
		ngfw c&c blocking	  (protect)
		dns redirect		  (protect)
		application control	  (detect)
		ioc 				  (detect)
		
		
 # Actions on Objective: attacker executes desire actions
 
		financial
		political
		espionage
		malicious insider
		lateral movement
